		<h2>Electronic Book Sales Revenue in the U.S.</h2>

		<p>For my Datawrapper chart, I chose to create a split bar chart to show my data because I felt it was a good way to show 10 years worth of data side by side. Because I was showing the data of 2 different book formats, E-books and Audio books, I differentiated them by using dark green bars for E-book sales and light green bars for the audio book sales.</p>
		<p>For my creative dataviz, I decided to make charts similar to bar charts using books to represent E-book sales and headphones to represent audio book sales. Whichever year had the highest sales for each format is highlighted using the color purple. The years are labeled on the X axis.</p>
		<p>In the future, if I were to edit these charts I would add one main thing to the creative dataviz chart. Although the book sales in million USD were written above the bar, I would also add values on the Y axis to signify the amount of money. If I were to change the Datawrapper chart, I'd try to find a different format that does not show zeros in the chart where there is no value. The chart makes it seem as if the sales were $0 for that year, however, there is just no data collected.</p>
